# COVID-19 Tracker

Coronavirus tracker

## Let's collect the data together

Let's fight this virus together by adding data to the app

--------------------------------------------------------------

[update Apr 2, 2020] The project was discontinued due to Apple's and Google's restriction on apps that try to fight the COVID-19 epidemic unless are published by governments or health organizations.

It was a 25 hour-long project in total.


Live web app created by Flutter: [covid19-world-tracker.web.app](https://covid19-world-tracker.web.app) For best experience open it up on a smart phone with high performance processor. Web apps created by Flutter at this point (Apr 2, 2020) are in beta and therefore lack performance.
